Release 0.96	2004-12-13
	* fixed a nasty bug where images were often saved in
		half-res/lower quality
	* In ImageMagick 6.1.x, Unsharp Mask parameter scaling has
		changed back to how it was in ImageMagick 5; added #ifdef
		to supply correct arguments for all known ImageMagick
		versions from 5 to 6.1.6. These parameter changes are
		very annoying, as Unsharp Mask simply does not work
		with incorrect arguments
	* added Unsharp Mask radius selection to file save options dialog
	* file open/save controls are now greyed out when processing
		is pending
	* fixed a memory leak that leaked ca 256k at each image open

Release 0.95	2004-12-11
	* if image is (approximately) more than 2x larger than our
		window, and we are loading it using dcraw, then load it
		with dcraw -h option (half res, much faster) at first
		and only when needed re-load it in full res
	* added angle calculations to spot info (mouse click on image)
	* when holding down Shift key while clicking on image with mouse,
		the input file pixel RGB values are now copied to clipboard
		as a tab-separated table
	* replaced Red and Blue color balance sliders with Red/Blue
		(white balance) and Green sliders, which should correspond
		better to what is usually needed in actual practice
	* changed default contrast slider setting from 1.6 to 1.3
	* removed Canon CRW image auto-rotation, as it is now
		implemented in newer versions of dcraw
	* changed color correction matrix for Canon EOS 10D and D30
	* fixed a bug where window position was saved incorrectly
		if you just resized the window without moving it;
		this seems to be a bug in Qt
	* "Open next numbered image" now handles numbering gaps of
		up to 500, not 100 as before
	* added -matrix command-line option to calculate color
		correction matrix based on measurements
	* added "using namespace MagickLib" to make compilable with
		newer (6.0.7+) ImageMagick
	* declared .PHONY targets in Makefile

Release 0.94	2004-06-20
	* fixed a bug where aspect ratio was (incorrectly) preserved
		during Save As resizing
	* changed Unsharp Mask arguments as they apparently have changed
		in ImageMagick version 6
	* file load and save dialogs now remember the directory of last
		file loaded or saved
	* on Save As, file extension is now appended automatically if needed
	* changed the focus policy of sliders to gain keyboard focus
		on mouse clicks
	* changed static build so that ImageMagick is no longer linked
		statically, leaving Qt as the only statically linked component
	* added try-catch blocks to catch ImageMagick Image::read()
		exceptions and report them to stdout

Release 0.93	2004-05-19
	* added focused distance to shooting info dialog. Apparently only newer
		Canon EF lenses provide this info to body, though.
	* fixed a bug where CRW shooting info exposure time was incorrect for
		exposures longer than about 1 sec
	* fixed a bug where spot RGB values calculation did not take crop status
		into account
	* release build now creates a SRPM, static Linux binary, and static RPM
